          <p>A toucanBox subscription craft box contains all the materials needed to complete a craft project, with illustrated instructions, stickers to collect and an activity magazine.</p>

          <p>I worked with toucanBox from April 2016 to September 2018. I carried out this project in my role as research and development (R&amp;D) Manager. Shortly after I joined the Technology Team in a full-time product role.</p>

          <p>
           To get a full introduction to toucanBox you can read the first segment of toucanBox chapter 1 Refining the value proposition. <br>

            Customer acquisition and retention were two of the most discussed performance metrics at toucanBox. This project however, focused on an equally important but somewhat subtler metric; the rate at which trialists convert to fully paid customers (activation rate).
          </p>

          <p>We knew that the top reason for cancellation in trial was &lsquo;affordability and the second top &lsquo;value for money. For some time, I had taken part in wistful conversations about whether digital content could help in this regard. This kind of content could complement the product without increasing the unit cost. I lobbied to explore this theme further and received a green light for a thorough investigation.</p>

          <p>Key observations through testing:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>For the most part, even young children have learned common interface signifiers and touch gestures, e.g. arrows or swipe for carousels, pinch to zoom, play icon, video scrub, cross icon to exit</li>
            <li>Games usually featured a single play experience</li>
            <li>The best play experiences are open-ended, with no natural conclusion, so that the duration of play is the childs attention span</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Notably, the games from leading studios are never competitive, which is one of the main features of games aimed at teenagers and adults.</p>

          <p>Development of a fully-fledged mobile app was out of scope for this test. I decided to play to our strengths - the experience should be online, built with web technologies and accessed via a printed URL or QR code in the box.</p>

          <p>QR codes appeared to offer a way to reduce the friction of moving from printed media to online content. However, further investigation revealed that the IOS camera app had recently dropped support, effectively removing any advantage of this approach.</p>

          <h4>Selecting a prototype to move forward</h4>
          <p>
            AR looked like an exciting way to mix the tangible aspects of a craft box with digital content. However, in 2016 web AR was nowhere near mature enough for a live test with actual customers. My low-fi AR prototype was built in Unity. For the purposes of this test, a Unity application and a release to app stores was clearly out of scope. The Toucanoo prototype had an equally positive reception and would be much easier to build.
          </p>

          <h3>Detailing the Toucanoo colouring sheet maker</h3>
          <p>My next steps were to refine the Toucanoo prototype by taking action on test feedback and improving the visual design.</p>

            I chose html canvas as the foundational technology for both the low-fi prototype and the production build. My rationale was performance on low-spec mobile devices, which could lean on their graphics processor (GPU) to keep animation smooth. I relied on two libraries to speed up development:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Pixi.js offered a simplified canvas API and built in GPU acceleration</li>
            <li>Jekyll and Jekyll multi-language plugin automated the generation of translated html pages (in English, French, Italian and German)</li>

          <h4>What went well?</h4>

          <p><strong>Triple average time on page</strong> compared to the rest of the site</p>

          <p><strong>56 minutes</strong> longest session</p>

          <p>Internal enthusiasm and agreement that it <strong>embodied toucanBoxs values</strong></p>


          <h4>What didnt go so well?</h4>

          <p><strong>3.4% of trialists</strong> accessed the experience</p>

          <p>The friction I anticipated in moving from the box to the online content played out in practice, reflected by the relatively low engagement. Correspondingly, I measured <strong>no noticeable change to activation rate</strong></p>


          <h4>The future</h4>

          <p>Was there a future for digital interactive experiences as part of the toucanBox value proposition? </p>

          <p>Not in the short-term, due to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Considerable investment of time and energy</li>
            <li>Specialist expertise required for the best experience (e.g. in native app development)</li>
            <li>Uncertain impact</li>
            <li>Many competitor children's apps already embody toucanBoxs values (Creative, time well spent, educational)</li>
            <li>Compelling digital-physical connection requires technologies which arent yet widespread (e.g. AR), or which are very expensive (e.g. Electronics)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>However, the project served to inspire the toucanBox team and suggested future possibilities:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Creating a Toucanoo character could form part of a more personalised experience</li>
            <li>Digital experiences could be a new marketing channel e.g. presence in app stores</li>
          </ul>
