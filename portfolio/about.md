I take time and energy throughout the design process to carefully understand and unify the needs of both the user and the stakeholders(s). This care extends throughout the feature development, design process, and production phase by testing early and often. I’m passionate about filtering complex problems into simple and actionable solutions which allows people to be more efficient with their time.

I strive to push the world forward by creating a bridge between people and technology.

experiment across different disciplines and fields. With a focus on exploring the intersection between art direction, interaction, moving image and emerging technologies. Deep understanding of my clients - ranging from start-ups to global brands — to deliver meaningful, lasting experiences through playful interactions and rigorous design thinking.

Having an academic background in computer science and design, I have led the design of complex projects at an array of organizations that include SoundCloud, IBM, Zalando, Babbel, T-Mobile, IDAGIO, and Veee™ over the last decade.

My services cover multiple stages of the product development cycle including design sprints, user research, interaction design, user interface design, prototyping, and branding.

I strive to build honest and purposeful products that deserve to exist. With the help of technology and design, I aim to blend simplicity with a delightful user experience, where there is a solid harmony of functionality, usability, and aesthetics. Process is important to me. I want to make work with heart, purpose, and originality, with collaborators and brands who value the same things.

Previously, I joined Dropbox as an early product designer and second illustrator on the team, and before that I studied management, marketing, and operations at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.

Inspired by experimental methods within contemporary art and design, natural sciences and engineering, her work could be seen as ongoing research, oscillating in the media art field.

Time-critical MVPs at startups to large-scale platform overhauls affecting millions of users

turning insights into effective concepts

I believe great product design comes from a focus on the right questions, not the right answers.

Throughout my experience as a designer, I've had the pleasure of working with some talented and passionate people, striving for a shared goal in created the best experience for the end user and also the clients.

Anthony Moles is a multidisciplinary designer and artist who creates data-driven experiences. He is interested in finding harmonies between digital and physical materials. He is currently dreaming up the future of spatial computing at ---.  

I'm an independent illustrator and artist who loves drawing and designing physical experiences for other people. I draw illustrations, create illustration brand systems with heart, paint murals, and design physical installations and experiences that bring people closer together.

I have more than a decade of expertise that covers the entire human-centred design process: from research and strategy to finished interface design and front-end development. My background is in design, which is complemented by a lifetime of tinkering with digital tools, languages, and technologies.

I started my career as a teacher and transitioned to UX about 10 years ago. But my career hasn’t been straightforward and my skillset includes variety of skills from UX, UI, PO, Mentorship, Coaching, and Leadership.

<h1 class="stage-title">Hello! I'm Ant</h1>

<p class="subtitle">
  A designer and leader creating useful and playful experiences centred on people
</p>

Let’s break that down a bit. I started my career as a [Toy Designer at LEGO](/projects/lego), having trained in [Product Design Engineering](http://www.gsa.ac.uk/study/undergraduate-degrees/product-design-engineering/) at the Glasgow School of Art. I transitioned into UX about 5 years ago, pursuing a desire to blend technology and interactivity into my design practice. Recently I've been leading an agile product team as a [Product Manager](/projects/ecosia). But I haven't forgotten my roots and I'm at my best when bridging digital/physical and design/technology divides.

I've had the pleasure to collaborate with great people on diverse products, from time-critical [MVPs](/projects/toucanbox) at startups to [iterative features](/projects/ecosia/#product-design-at-scale) reaching millions of users. My natural curiosity, adaptability and love of learning have led me to play varied roles. A lifetime of tinkering with tools, languages and technologies enables me to empathise with engineering stakeholders as much as I do with users.

What drives me is the belief that everyone's creativity and learning can be enhanced by technology. By distilling complexity through design, I strive to open up this potential to wider audiences. I see rigorously designed interfaces with playful interactions as a key ingredient. Another is iteration - testing with users early and often. _The human-centred design process is the thread that runs through my career._

Rapha feedback highlights

- Homepage 'led' reasonably well
- 'Experiments' title should be more specific
- Drawn to Stompy Robot title - entrepreneurial - is it too effective?
- Would expect case studies to be behind every button, case study label helps though
- Drawn to Ecosia - colour - but scrolling understands I'm trying to focus reader on wesen
- TLDR would help for case-studies - maybe hide content behind a button? Considered the possibility of sidebar or toc
- Split up toucanBox? - notices scroll bar and sees how much scrolling is needed
- Try to cut where possible Wesen is already over the maximum
- A little lost among initial content - could be reworked - show more of a path through, what to focus on
- Show more imagery up front on Wesen? (And toucanBox x2 case studies?) e.g. how it looked in the end.
- Questioned presenting the company front-and-centre for each project page - more interested in me, what I did, what I'm like, rather than companies
- Selected further reading/content rather than next, back (questioned the implicit, rather than specific affordances)
- Use the word affordances somewhere in a case study! Ideally Wesen - control points.
- Clearly put a lot of effort in, knows what he's talking about
- Confirmed reading of titles and bold, large text
- Not that interested in 'About' but impressed - good. Might not read if coming from application
- Timeline - it's life milestones
- Overall felt it displayed artistic sensibilities
