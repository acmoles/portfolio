## Context

A toucanBox subscription craft box contains all the materials needed to complete a craft project, with illustrated instructions, stickers to collect and an activity magazine.

In my hybrid role as digital product designer and R&D manager, I was given a broad remit to tackle projects across the customer journey. I set strict criteria - setting up a _Project Passport_ to ensure we were laser focussed on key metrics.

Consequently, some initiatives aimed to improve the experience for children, some for parents and often both benefited. The [other toucanBox case study](/toucanbox) covers two projects focussing on parents.

Create by toucanBox aims to move the needle for _customer activation_ - the rate at which trialists convert to fully paying subscribers. We knew the top two reasons for cancellation in trial were _affordability_ and _value for money._ My hypothesis was that exclusive digital content could help address this, without increasing the variable cost of the box.

###  The challenge

Establish to what extent digital content linked to the trial box can increase activation rate. Estimate the costs and benefits of producing more digital content.

</template>

<template v-slot:column2>

### The outcome

Must resonate with the core value proposition (hands-on crafting and creativity). High friction when moving to a device from the magazine reduced the reach leading to low overal impact.

## Research

<p class="subtitle">
  I asked existing toucanBox customers what ‘value for money’ means to them and gathered their attitudes to children's digital media.
</p>

Customer acquisition and retention were two of the most discussed performance metrics at toucanBox. This project however, focused on an equally important but somewhat subtler metric; the rate at which trialists convert to fully paid customers (activation rate).

**Observation** | **Remedy** |
--- | --- |
*"My Toucanoo is called Wendy"*  Many children named their Toucanoos, even if they werent able to write the names | I added a text box in the print modal where an older child or parent could type the name and have it appear on the printout |
*"Theres no skirt!"*  Several important accessories were clearly missing | I added skirts, wellington boots and several other accessories |
*"I dont want this one"*  Children wanted to be able to delete accessories | I observed children dragging items off the screen, attempting to delete them, so made that actually work |
Certain types of accessory like hats, clothes and shoes quickly cluttered the screen and didnt make sense out of their intended positions | I made new placements in specific categories (e.g. hair) remove the previous accessory of that type. This proved to be an intuitive limitation |
Parents found it hard to get printing to work. It depended a great deal on the device, configuration and their technical aptitude | I added the possibility of saving directly as a PDF and a printing FAQ page |
Many adult testers requested that hand-held items move when the hand moves | This proved tricky to implement in the existing system, so I decided not to include it for the pilot |
