We had just witnessed the dawn of ubiquitous touch-based tablet computing and believed we could exploit this fresh input medium to reimagine some of our favourite game genres.
</p>

In 2013 I joined forces with my brother [Simon Moles](https://www.simonmoles.com/) (systems developer at [Rockstar North](https://www.rockstarnorth.com/)) to build video games specifically for tablet devices. We worked in the Unity game engine, enabling us to target all major platforms.

<p>
Our guiding principle was touch-centricity. Mobile games of the time often borrowed existing interaction models, such as on-screen joysticks or pointers. We wanted to play to the strengths of touch. Our pioneering effort was Nova (below), <Content-ModalLink label="Spaced">
<template v-slot:modal>
<Content :page-key="$site.pages.find(p => p.path === '/extra/spaced/').key"/>
</template>
</Content-ModalLink> was our last game title in development.
</p>

Rather than games, the studio's breakthrough success was with development tools. The insights gained building games enabled us to identify valuable workflow improvements in coding and debugging. [SRDebugger](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/srdebugger-console-tools-on-device-27688) is still available on the Unity Asset Store.

## Nova

<p class="subtitle">
  A tactical action RTS which specifically leverages the interaction opportunities offered by touch screens.
</p>

The player commands an elite squad of starship captains who must defend the freedom of the galaxy. Battle against ambitious new factions seeking galactic dominance. As the player progresses, they collect new starships, characters, weaponry and equipment. Each possess advantages and abilities, which can be combined into effective strategies for defeating any opponent.

Players will acquire new heroes and weaponry as they progress in the game. Heroes and weapons have unique abilities which the player can combine to develop the most effective strategy for defeating their opponents.

Nova is a squad-based action RPG for tablet devices. I collaborated with an artist to create the visual style, silhouetting ships against a bright background and overlaying heavy glow effects for weapons, engines, highlights. A major focus was to take advantage of touch controls and streamlining interactions with the UI and squad control.

Across all popular mobile platforms (iOS, Windows, Android), we design and craft fun, touch-centric games. We believe that a game should be designed for touch, fully exploiting the fresh input medium provided by this new technology.
