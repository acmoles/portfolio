## Context

In 2013 I joined forces with my brother [Simon Moles](https://www.simonmoles.com/) (systems developer at [Rockstar North](https://www.rockstarnorth.com/)) to build video games specifically for mobile devices. We had just witnessed the dawn of ubiquitous touch-based computing and believed we could exploit this fresh input medium to reimagine some of our favourite game genres.

We worked in the Unity game engine, enabling us to target all major platforms. Our guiding principle was touch-centricity. Mobile games of the time often borrowed existing interaction models, such as on-screen joysticks or pointers. We wanted to play to the strengths of touch.

<p>
The studio's breakthrough success was with development tools, rather than games. The insights gained building games enabled us to identify valuable workflow improvements in coding and debugging. <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/srdebugger-console-tools-on-device-27688" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SRDebugger</a> is still available on the Unity Asset Store. <Content-ModalLink label="Spaced">

Across all popular mobile platforms (iOS, Windows, Android), we design and craft fun, touch-centric games. We believe that a game should be designed for touch, fully exploiting the fresh input medium provided by this new technology.

Nova is a squad-based action RPG for tablet devices. I collaborated with an artist to create the visual style, silhouetting ships against a bright background and overlaying heavy glow effects for weapons, engines, highlights. A major focus was to take advantage of touch controls and streamlining interactions with the UI and squad control.


Nova is an action-strategy game for tablet devices. The player controls an elite squad of heroes in the far future as they endeavour to defeat the oppressive galactic powers present in the Milky Way galaxy.

Players will acquire new heroes and weaponry as they progress in the game. Heroes and weapons have unique abilities which the player can combine to develop the most effective strategy for defeating their opponents.
