Ecosia is a search engine that uses 80% of profits from advertising to plant trees around the world, where they're needed the most.
</p>

<!-- We made impressive progress on our mobile apps with only two developers and a share of my overall capacity as a product designer.  -->

The primary purpose of the apps is to make searching with Ecosia easy on major platforms. Additionally, we enrich our search results with green data to help users make sustainable choices while on the go. 

Web search is naturally multi-platform and one way in which devices augment our mental abilities. It resides in a meta space close to the OS. So _it's critically important that Ecosia's apps fit seamlessly into users' daily lives_. As product manager and team leader for the mobile team, I sought to ground my decisions in user empathy, balanced with technical and platform knowledge.

<!--

I lead the mobile apps team. Our native Android and iOS apps make it easy to search with Ecosia, connect with the cause and make an incremental difference every day while on the go. My activities include:

Product management | UI/UX design | interactive prototypes | usability and value testing | product illustrations | analytics, optimisation, A/B testing (custom tooling with Looker) | embedded with developers in an agile product team

When I joined Ecosia as a product designer, native apps were part of a large product team with a broad remit for user engagement. In this environment I was able to pioneer several initiatives for mobile - growing our user numbers so that we could begin to consider investing resources and concerted attention into this space.

I initially joined Ecosia as a product designer and gradually transitioned into a product manager role, forming a new team in the process.

<template v-slot:caption>

We planned and built this [geo-data visualisation](https://mapvis.netlify.app/) of realtime searches by Ecosia users (and our tree planting projects) over four days in Hack Week 2019. This version of the visualisation uses a looping 5 minute snapshot rather than the live data feed. I collaborated with a back-end developer and data analyst, where my focus was design and code for the front-end. 

<!-- Plotting user searches beside tree planting sites allowed us to see that some users in Brazil are within 10km of rainforest restored by Ecosia. -->

## Product design at scale

<p>
When I joined Ecosia it was at an inflection point. We would soon experience rapid growth, reaching over 10 million daily users. The organisation scaled accordingly and the design guild doubled. At that time it was critical to foster collaborative practices, establish a set of design principles and take the first steps towards a component-based design system. These considerations were forefront in my mind as I worked on projects such as <Content-ModalLink label="Maps">

<div class="column">

Ecosia maps posed a unique design challenge. As part of slicing the feature we decided to exclude the search box from the first release. Rather, we would enable users to make pseudo searches for common keywords such as hotels and shopping. 

These constraints called for creativity; our interim solution was a 'dial pad' of common map search queries which we were confident we could serve in a. It was satisfying to work on a completely new search vertical, laying the foundations for iterative improvements.

## Product designer to product manager

<p class="subtitle" style="padding-right: 1em;">
  With a growing user base and a renewed strategic focus on mobile, in mid 2019 it was time to found a new agile product team with a focus on mobile apps.
</p>

Having been closely involved on a strategic level as a product designer, I was a natural fit to take on the role of product manager and team leader. Over the next three months we grew the team from two to four developers and added a dedicated designer.

Leading projects and mentoring individuals gave me a good foundation to take on a position of formal team leadership, but I was glad conditions were favourable. My relationships with the founding team members were strong. Everyone in the team responded well to a culture promoting trust, autonomy and respect.

### Mobile team highlights

<p>
Early on, we had a standout success with the iOS App. Users were telling us that the app lagged in usability and missed key browser features. Browsing tabs were the top request. I worked closely with developers to shape an interface we named the <Content-ModalLink label="Organiser">

<div class="column">

The Organiser enables users to do typcial browsing tasks with tabs, favourites, history and settings. With this long-awaited feature the iOS app could stand as a viable alternative browser to Safari.

This offers a ready&#8209;made, familiar browsing experience but at the cost of enormous investment to keep it up-to-date. <em>I facilitated a design thinking process with developers where we identified ways we might accelerate the update process.</em> Then I helped them prioritise initiatives, slice the work, establish milestones and finally evaluate based on success criteria. My technical background enabled me to participate meaningfully in discussions and offer effective leadership.

// SAFARI CUT

<p>
The greatest business impact came from two projects where I supported the team to deliver complex technical solutions. Apple were poised to remove their existing extension platform from Safari. 15% of daily searches came from users relying on this extension. We rapidly built a replacement <Content-ModalLink label="Safari App Extension">

Our browser extensions add Ecosia as default search engine. Users expect that they can search with Ecosia directly in the address bar. At first, we were uncertain we could deliver this functionality and implemented a dropdown search box in the Safari UI as contingency.

I led design of the accounts beta release, enabling users to save and share their personal impact counter across devices. Our hypothesis was that already engaged users would love this feature. We found demand was so high that users outside our testing region began clamouring to be included in the pilot.
