<p class="subtitle">
Art Lebedev Studio is the first and largest independent design studio in Russia. Founded in 1995, today it has over 300 employees.
</p>

The studio is best known internationally for the [Optimus Maximus](https://www.artlebedev.com/optimus/) keyboard which features a customisable OLED display in every key. Within Russia it's famous for redesigning the Moscow metro map and synonymous with internet brands like Yandex and Alfa-bank.

I was attracted by the irreverent humour and the product design department's emphasis on craft. As an intern, I was immediately treated as a fully fledged member of the team and thrown into diverse projects covering consumer electronics, aviation, gifts, architecture and urban objects.

My motivation to pursue an opportunity in far-flung Moscow was to refine my skills, particularly sketching and styling form. Just under 9 months emulating the studio's house style under the highest standards for quality have left a lasting impression on my design practice.


### NITA air traffic control

The most challenging project, where I also had the most impact, was a modular air traffic control console for NITA. We were struggling with stringent constraints (regulatory, cost, historical) and team morale was low. After persevering with many iterations, I eventually reached a design that satisfied the client. The creative director notes this in my recommendation on [Linkedin](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/anthonymoles).

The console can be configured for various purposes including command post, flight controller and operations. In each case there are strict international regulations regarding ergonomics and safety. Further details of the design process are available [here](https://www.artlebedev.com/nita/process/).

Automotive inspired consumer product design. I've always admired the craft and skill involved in automotive design. , with influences from automotive design, a discipline I've always admired

Outsider status is appealing. So is the irreverent sense of humour. I wanted to learn this craft for myself. To be able to channel the studio house style.

#### Iron Logic door entry system

The device is multi-functional, supporting facial recognition, keycards and dongals. It can be fastened to a wall or place on a table. The design attempts to harmonize these requirements.

</template>

<template slot="slot2">

#### Oktopus toilet plunger

It started as a humorous 'what if?' and became a gift item sold in designer stores. The challenge was to find an iconic form that worked with the typical materials and manufacturing methods of toilet plungers.

<template slot="slot3">

#### Scout helicopter

I was privileged to be involved in interior, exterior and interface design for this concept light helicopter. It aims to offer never-before seen simplicity and affordability.
