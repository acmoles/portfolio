<p class="subtitle">
Art Lebedev Studio is the first and largest independent design studio in Russia. Founded in 1995, today it has over 300 employees.
</p>

The studio is best known internationally for the [Optimus Maximus](https://www.artlebedev.com/optimus/) keyboard which features a customisable OLED display in every key. Within Russia it's famous for redesigning the Moscow metro map and synonymous with internet brands like Yandex and Alfa-bank.

I was attracted by the irreverent humour and the product design department's emphasis on craft, with influences from automotive design, a discipline I've always admired. As an intern, I was immediately treated as a fully fledged member of the team and thrown into diverse projects covering consumer electronics, aviation, gifts, architecture and urban objects.

My motivation to pursue an opportunity in far-flung Moscow was to refine my skills, particularly sketching and styling form. Just under 9 months emulating the studio's house style under the highest standards for quality have left a lasting impression on my design practice.



<!--

Automotive inspired consumer product design. I've always admired the craft and skill involved in automotive design.

Outsider status is appealing. So is the irreverent sense of humour. I wanted to learn this craft for myself. To be able to channel the studio house style.

Anthony has shown a great persistence on one particular project where almost everyone in the design team lost hope due to very strict technological, ergonomic and layout constrains. He literally saved the project and brought back optimism and belief.

<template slot="slot1">

#### NITA air traffic control

The console can be configured for various purposes including command post, flight controller and operations. In each case there are strict international regulations regarding ergonomics and safety.

</template>

<template slot="slot2">

#### Oktopus toilet plunger

It started as a humorous 'what if?' and became a product for ALS's network of designer stores. The challenge lay in finding an iconic form which could be convincingly represented to cost in the typical materials of a plunger.

<template slot="slot3">

#### Scout helicopter

I was privileged to be involved in interior, exterior and interface design for this concept light helicopter. It aims to offer never-before seen simplicity and affordability.
