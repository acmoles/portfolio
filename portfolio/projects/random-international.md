Random International design and build technology-powered interactive art installations. My ongoing focus is bridging the real and digital worlds, challenging current thinking about interactivity and exploring how people relate to rapidly changing technology. So I was very please to join them as an intern in 2010.

In the first weeks I helped assemble and install [Swarm Study III](https://www.random-international.com/swarm-study-iii-2011) in the V&A, I paid a maintenance visit to [Duplex](https://www.random-international.com/duplex-2011) and created a new PCB bracket for [Self Portrait](https://www.random-international.com/self-portrait-2010). Getting hands on with studio's existing artworks taught me a great deal about how to manufacture bespoke mechanical / electrical objects. It gave me a firm foundation to contribute meaningfully to the next project.

With [Fly](https://www.random-international.com/fly-2011), I began by researching solutions and talking to suppliers regarding challenges like structural glass, pulley systems and cable tensioning. My role gradually expanded so that by the time we packed the installation for shipment, I had been responsible for the design, prototyping and testing of almost every component.

<!-- Fortunately, the team didn't misplace their faith in me, although as we constructed the installation in Moscow I learnt some valuable lessons about designing for ease of assembly. -->

Random International design and build technology powered interactive art installations. I helped them create Fly, an exhibit for the 4th Moscow Biennial of Contemporary Art. My involvement spanned refining the concept to independently detailing the design; CAD, prototyping, sourcing and manufacture.

As a student
bringing real-life experiences into the digital world, challenging current thinking of technology interaction
As a student of of Product Design Engineering, this was exactly the blend of design and technology
Sought out. Lacking technology (interactivity, digital, software, blend) human responses to technology and the rapidly changing conditions of present day life. Emotional experiences.

Fly studies the movement of objects and insects within a confined space. An abstract representation of a fly is held captive inside a glass box, centrally ensnared by eight cables. The behaviour of this fly is controlled by a unique and autonomous algorithm, accurately simulating the observed behaviour of real flies. The fly has the freedom to move anywhere within its box, but lacks spatial reference. RANDOM INTERNATIONAL has applied this pattern of movement to an inanimate object, as though it were trapped beneath a watch-glass; exploring not only the behaviour of objects but also that of humans. When the fly senses the presence of a person at its perimeter, it changes the demeanour of its flight in response. This continuing physical interplay of action and reaction can offer a new perspective to our own behaviour, its effects, and apparent freedom, in the current age. Fly premiered at the 4th Moscow Biennial of Contemporary Art, curated by Peter Weibel.

the groupâ€™s work invites active participation. RANDOM INTERNATIONAL explores the human condition in an increasingly mechanised world through emotional yet physically intense experiences.  -->
