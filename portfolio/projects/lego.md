My early career was defined by my time at LEGO, both in-house and later as a consultant at [Design by Touch](https://www.designbytouch.com/). Among diverse projects including Nexo Knights, Bionicle, Hero Factory, City, Mario and numerous undisclosed concepts, Dimensions stands out as my enduring favourite. Even more gratifying, it broke out of the concept phase and into the real world. It's the LEGO answer to Skylanders, Disney Infinity, and Nintendo Amiibo (toys-to-life). I joined the core team as we took it from back-of-the-napkin idea to major strategic initiative backed by the whole company.

LEGO's unique DNA sets Dimensions apart from competitors. We wanted to push forward what it means to blend toys and video games into a single experience. One route was to emphasise building and rebuilding as part of the integrated gameplay. Contextual on-screen building instructions show children how to modify their models to solve puzzles and beat challenges. Another was to stimulate roleplaying in the real world. We saw the hardware as more than just a gateway for bringing LEGO into the game. It was also a new kind of gamepad which facilitated interactions triggered by the toy's physical state. Dimensions launched in 2015 to overwhelmingly positive reviews but was cancelled in 2017 as the broader category fell out of favour with children and parents.

It brings together unlikely allies in a mash-up multiverse.


Encourage kids to build crazy cross-brand combinations. This is the essence of LEGO. It's what children are gleefully doing themselves already. As part of the value proposition: only possible given LEGOs amazing relationships with global entertainment brands. Linking to the LEGO Movie.


Characters, power-ups and vehicles are loaded into the game by placing them on the Toypad.
Children are encouraged to build and rebuild models to solve puzzles and challenges, following contextual on-screen building instructions.

LEGO's unique DNA sets it apart.

Bridging the gap between bricks and video games

Like any LEGO building set, LEGO Dimensions is a system of play - expandable platform for digital crossover play.

Children
Physical characters, powerups and vehicles are loaded into the game by placing them on the Toypad. Assigning the tag in the Toypad teleportation core and then placing the model and tag in the play space. Save the Toy Tag with the current character or model. On-screen building instructions.

Emphasised building and rebuilding as part of the gameplay. Built and rebuilt, unlocking new powers and abilities.
3-in-1 Building. Build and then rebuild to power-up every vehicle and gadget. Each can be built a total of three times providing super-charged, in-game abilities with each upgrade.
The LEGO Toy Pad is more than a gateway for bringing physical LEGO into the game. It's also a new kind of gamepad. It lights-up, flashes and even changes color to give players clues as to where to go, what to look for, or how to solve a puzzle. Gamers command the action – where and when the physical toys are moved on the LEGO Toy Pad will impact what happens in the game.


Where the game's innovative designs push forward what it means to blend toys and games into a single experience


Fulfilling a childhood dream working as an intern at LEGO in Billund. Later as a design consultant via Design by Touch.
This is one of my favourite projects. Among dozens I developed for LEGO. With the greatest reach.

 One standout projects was LEGO Dimensions, where I helped develop a unique approach to the toys-to-life category.

 Get your builder a LEGO® DIMENSIONS™ mash-up multiverse! They can collect their favourite characters and bring them to life in the video game!

 When a mysterious and powerful vortex suddenly appears in various LEGO worlds, different characters from DC Comics, The Lord of the Rings and The LEGO Movie are swept away. To save their friends, Batman, Gandalf and Wyldstyle bravely jump into the vortex and quickly find themselves fighting to save all of LEGO humanity. Let creativity be the guide to a building and gaming adventure - journey through unexpected worlds and team-up with unlikely allies on the quest to defeat the evil Lord Vortech. Play with different from different worlds together in one LEGO videogame, and use each other's vehicles and gadgets in a way never before possible. LEGO Bad Cop driving the DeLorean Time Machine. Why not?! The LEGO Ninja go Masters of Spinjitsu fighting alongside Wonder Woman...yes, please! Get ready to break the rules, because the only rule with LEGO Dimensions is that there are no rules.

The LEGO DIMENSIONS Starter Pack has everything you need to set out on epic mash-up adventures filled with iconic worlds and unlikely allies as you’ve never seen them before. Build the minifigure heroes and fire-up the game to start the experience, then follow the in-game build instructions to assemble the loose bricks into the LEGO Gateway, and place the structure on the LEGO Toy Pad.  There’s a whole multiverse of puzzles to solve, and challenges and enemies to face, and when you’re ready for more, collect level, team & fun packs to expand your collection. Use whatever minifigure with whichever vehicle or gadget – go ahead… break the rules!
