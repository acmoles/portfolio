## Context

My early career was defined by my work for LEGO, both in-house and later as a consultant with Design by Touch. Dimensions is one of my favourite projects, which happily broke out of the concept phase and into the real world. It's LEGO's answer to Skylanders, Disney Infinity, and Nintendo Amiibo. LEGO's unique DNA sets it apart. I was the main interaction and industrial design resource on this project as we took it from back-of-the-napkin idea to major strategic initiative with the full weight of the company behind it.


Bridging the gap between bricks and video games

Of all the products which I worked on and this is one of my favourite projects.

Toys to life like

Fulfilling a childhood dream working as an intern at LEGO in Billund. Later as a design consultant via Design by Touch.
This is one of my favourite projects. Among dozens I developed for LEGO. With the greatest reach.

Like any LEGO building set, LEGO Dimensions is a system of play - expandable platform for digital crossover play.

Children
Physical characters, powerups and vehicles are loaded into the game by placing them on the Toypad. Assigning the tag in the Toypad teleportation core and then placing the model and tag in the play space. Save the Toy Tag with the current character or model. On-screen building instructions.
Emphasised building and rebuilding as part of the gameplay. Built and rebuilt, unlocking new powers and abilities.
3-in-1 Building. Build and then rebuild to power-up every vehicle and gadget. Each can be built a total of three times providing super-charged, in-game abilities with each upgrade.
The LEGO Toy Pad is more than a gateway for bringing physical LEGO into the game. It's also a new kind of gamepad. It lights-up, flashes and even changes color to give players clues as to where to go, what to look for, or how to solve a puzzle. Gamers command the action – where and when the physical toys are moved on the LEGO Toy Pad will impact what happens in the game.
Encourage kids to build crazy cross-brand combinations. This is the essence of LEGO. It's what children are gleefully doing themselves already. As part of the value proposition: only possible given LEGOs amazing relationships with global entertainment brands. Linking to the LEGO Movie.

Where the game's innovative designs push forward what it means to blend toys and games into a single experience

<!--

 One standout projects was LEGO Dimensions, where I helped develop a unique approach to the toys-to-life category.

 Get your builder a LEGO® DIMENSIONS™ mash-up multiverse! They can collect their favourite characters and bring them to life in the video game!

 When a mysterious and powerful vortex suddenly appears in various LEGO worlds, different characters from DC Comics, The Lord of the Rings and The LEGO Movie are swept away. To save their friends, Batman, Gandalf and Wyldstyle bravely jump into the vortex and quickly find themselves fighting to save all of LEGO humanity. Let creativity be the guide to a building and gaming adventure - journey through unexpected worlds and team-up with unlikely allies on the quest to defeat the evil Lord Vortech. Play with different from different worlds together in one LEGO videogame, and use each other's vehicles and gadgets in a way never before possible. LEGO Bad Cop driving the DeLorean Time Machine. Why not?! The LEGO Ninja go Masters of Spinjitsu fighting alongside Wonder Woman...yes, please! Get ready to break the rules, because the only rule with LEGO Dimensions is that there are no rules.

The LEGO DIMENSIONS Starter Pack has everything you need to set out on epic mash-up adventures filled with iconic worlds and unlikely allies as you’ve never seen them before. Build the minifigure heroes and fire-up the game to start the experience, then follow the in-game build instructions to assemble the loose bricks into the LEGO Gateway, and place the structure on the LEGO Toy Pad.  There’s a whole multiverse of puzzles to solve, and challenges and enemies to face, and when you’re ready for more, collect level, team & fun packs to expand your collection. Use whatever minifigure with whichever vehicle or gadget – go ahead… break the rules!
