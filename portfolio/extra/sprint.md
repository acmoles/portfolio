## Context

In dui odio, posuere eget tristique in, pellentesque nec dolor. Vestibulum quis metus purus. Fusce varius rhoncus enim sit amet semper. Maecenas non nunc id justo vehicula ultricies vestibulum eget ex. Integer mattis faucibus nunc, ut tristique magna bibendum sit amet.

Suspendisse ornare et mi sit amet lacinia. Proin eget dui purus. Aliquam a cursus erat, sit amet ultricies risus. Nulla at arcu sagittis, egestas libero ut, finibus massa.

Maecenas non nunc id justo vehicula ultricies vestibulum eget ex. Integer mattis faucibus nunc, ut tristique magna bibendum sit amet. Suspendisse ornare et mi sit amet lacinia. Proin eget dui purus.

My interest lay specifically in full colour 3D printing of durable plastics suitable for children's toys.


LEGO was an early adopter of the 3D printing as part of the toy development process.

I pioneered the use of 3D printing in the toy development process at Design by Touch. At LEGO I saw how creative energy was unleashed when designers have ready access to physical representations of what they're working on digitally. The speed of the process.

I kept up-to-date with developments in the 3D printing industry. Promise of democratisation of 3D printing with increasing affordability of desktop machines.

Colour 3D printing is quite common - statues etc. - but not with mechanically durable plastic suitable for children's toys with articulated joints or mechanisms.

3D Systems released a machine which purported to deliver on this promise.

In response, I started experimenting with how the mechanical accuracy of 3D geometry created in industrial design and engineering modelling tools like Rhino 3D could be texture mapped in a similar fashion to 3D assets in the entertainment industry.

Sadly, existing machine was too brittle and to this day there isn't a ubiquitous machine capable of meeting colour with mechanical stability. HP is getting there.
3D printing - as a designer with interest across digital and physical - very interesting. Still not quite there yet (like Wesen blurb though...)

Theme - rocket powered athletes racing through your living room and dodging obstacles with their parkour skills. Drawing inspiration from sports brands and automotive design.
