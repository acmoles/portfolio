The best products elevate a commodity (like music or holidays, or crafts in this case) into a valuable holistic experience. After completing a user-centred design process focussing on customer onboarding, I had both a pool of insights and the momentum of a company-wide shift to a 'product mindset'.

<p>
The next challenge was customer retention. How might we make customers so satisfied with toucanBox that they want to stay subscribed for longer? Referring back to the research I conducted to generate toucanBox's 
<Content-ModalLink label="Product Principles">
<template v-slot:modal>
<Content :page-key="$site.pages.find(p => p.path === '/extra/toucanbox-principles/').key"/>
</template>
</Content-ModalLink>, we had a clear answer: <em>Get the right craft box to the right customer in the right quantity</em>. With a bespoke technology platform and a direct relationship with customers, toucanBox was uniquely positioned to leverage a personalised experience.
</p>

I created several concepts, the most successful in user testing we named the _Box builder_. We tested live-data prototypes on a limited audience in production, with promising results. Sadly I was unable to finish this project before my move to Berlin. I hired, onboarded and handed over the project to a new UX designer. Today the box builder is live as part of the signup flow and user accounts.

## Reflections

<p class="subtitle">
  "I wouldn't want to add my preferences if I can choose my box. It's basically the same thing, except choosing is better."
</p>

For me, this quote from one of my user testing sessions nicely captures the main challenge of this project - discovering the right personalised experience for toucanBox. I prototyped dozens of ideas, some of which were released as live beta tests to gather data insights, such as a past box rating system, child personality quiz and parent survey/preferences. What emerged were two strong themes. Customers either wanted to directly choose their next box(es) or they didn't want to be involved in personalising their experience at all. 

I believe this dichotomy reflects people's broader expectations of digital technology "Either I'm in total control, or I expect the algorithm to anticipate my needs". We knew we needed to tackle both these opportunities, for both types of user. Ultimately toucanBox customers should be able to choose their boxes months ahead (adding additional materials, books and other add-ons if desired) and provide as much or as little information about their child as they want, always getting the best possible box. The Box Builder focusses on choice but you can see from the sketch below I was imagining it as part of a broader interface that also included preferences and settings.
